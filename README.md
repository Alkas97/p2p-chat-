A simple p2p script designed to run in the command line. 
This was programmed in Python 3

To run the program just type py p2p.py. This will have your computer listen for a connection at your IP address. 
If you supply a command line argument, it will try to connect to that IP address. If it can't connect, it will 
start listening for a connection. Once a connection is made, chatting can occur back and forth to a max of 1024 bytes of unicode.
